Trained on vast datasets, frequently updating these models is expensive. Crucially, these challenges extend beyond the scope of studies in traditional continual learning, as foundation models require rapid and scalable adaptation to dynamic global changes and the emergence of both generalized and specialized tasks. This workshop addresses the urgent need for up-to-date foundation models. We invite researchers to explore cost-effective methods for frequent updates and adaptation, minimizing forgetting and deterioration, ensuring a consistent user experience, and designing dynamic evaluations that remain relevant as models evolve.",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Room 25ABC,2025-12-07T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109584,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109584,,

Building upon the Holistic Video Understanding (HVU) initiative and dataset introduced in 2019, we have successfully organized eight HVU workshops and tutorials at top-tier venues such as CVPR and ICCV, uniting researchers, practitioners, and students from around the world. These efforts have played a central role in moving the community beyond narrow action recognition tasks toward multi-faceted, semantic, and generalist video understanding.With the emergence of large-scale foundation models and video large language models (Video-LLMs), the landscape of video understanding is rapidly evolving. These models enable unified reasoning across spatial, temporal, and multimodal dimensions, yet introduce new challenges in scalability, efficiency, interpretability, and responsible deployment.The HVU Workshop 2025 will provide a platform to explore these frontiers, discussing topics such as multimodal representation learning, long-context reasoning, evaluation of general-purpose video systems, efficient adaptation and scaling laws, and the ethical and societal implications of video AI.

We will center our discussion on three challenges that are essential to progress across scientific domains: **LLM reasoning across scientific domains**– can present-day LLMs generate rigorously testable hypotheses and reason over experimental results that span scientific domains such as physics, chemistry, and biology? **Fidelity of generative and surrogate simulators**– In biology, we see a shift towards all-atom models with increasingly powerful capabilities, in chemistry machine learning force fields are increasing in accuracy and generalizability, and in climate modeling we can now accurately predict weather 15 days out. How far can we push this limit? What spatial or temporal scales remain intractable? **Experimental data scarcity and bias**. We see modern examples of large-scale dataset generation such as the Protein Data Bank, Human Cell Atlas, and the Materials Project. Are there other fields where AI can benefit most from consortium efforts to generate large-scale datasets? How far can models trained on limited experimental datasets take us and where are lab-in-the-loop strategies essential? To address this, we additionally introduce a **dataset proposal competition**. Our workshop will highlight common bottlenecks in developing AI methods across scientific application domains, and delve into solutions that can unlock progress across all of these domains.",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Ballroom 20A,2025-12-07T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109578,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109578,,

This workshop aims to catalyze interest and foster collaboration between the AI/ML and wireless communications communities. The timing of this workshop is especially significant, as the next-generation (NextG) wireless standardization efforts (such as 6G and WiFi 9) are just getting started, with AI-native technologies expected to play a central role across all aspects of the wireless ecosystem – from radio access to network management and edge intelligence. NextG represents a foundational shift in global infrastructure, enabling ultra-fast, low-latency, and intelligent connectivity that will power future applications in AI, robotics, immersive environments, and autonomous systems. These technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to both drive and benefit many applications, from healthcare and transportation to industrial automation and environmental monitoring. The economic and societal implications are vast: NextG networks will underlie trillions in global GDP impact, bridge digital divides, and shape how billions of people interact with technology and each other in the decades to come.<br><br>Despite the clear promise, a significant disconnect exists between the AI/ML and wireless research communities. AI/ML experts often lack an understanding of the unique physical, algorithmic, and architectural constraints inherent in wireless systems, while wireless researchers tend to adopt generic, off-the-shelf AI/ML models that are not optimized for the intricacies of wireless environments. Wireless environments are inherently dynamic, high-dimensional, and partially observable. These unique characteristics make them ideal testbeds for developing robust learning algorithms, particularly in areas like online learning, reinforcement learning, and in-context learning. At the same time, AI/ML techniques are becoming essential for managing the growing complexity of modern wireless networks, including resource allocation, interference mitigation, and cross-layer optimization. Bridging the gap between the two communities is not only necessary for meaningful technological advances but also critical for realizing the full societal impact of intelligent wireless systems.<br><br>This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and wireless to address the unique challenges and opportunities posed by Next-Generation (NextG) wireless systems. As the 6G era begins to take shape, AI-native designs have emerged as a cornerstone of wireless innovation, with the potential to transform the performance, efficiency, and adaptability of communication systems. The integration of AI/ML is poised to influence every layer of the network stack, from physical-layer signal processing to network control and resource management.",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Room 10,2025-12-06T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109576,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109576,,

A timely and critical challenge in AI is understanding what behaviors these models are actually capable of, and the internal processes which support these behaviors. As interest continues to grow in models’ internal processes, the field of cognitive science is becoming increasingly useful for describing and understanding cognition in deep learning models: cognitive science, which seeks to describe the cognitive processes in human and animal minds, offers a rich body of theories, experiments, and frameworks which may be adopted to understand how deep learning models achieve complex behaviors in domains such as language, vision, and reasoning.<br><br>The workshop will focus on Cognitive Interpretability (“CogInterp”), which involves the systematic interpretation of high-level cognition in deep learning models. Similar to how cognitive science describes the intermediate representations and algorithms (or cognition) between behavior and neurons in biological systems, the goal of Cognitive Interpretability is to describe the cognitive processes which lie between the levels of behavioral evaluations and mechanistic interpretability in deep learning models. Practically speaking, this means that Cognitive Interpretability does not just ask whether a model can perform task X or has a certain ability Y , but additionally (or instead) how a model performs X or learns and implements Y . These kinds of inferences—from observable behavior to latent “mental” processes—are the bread and butter of cognitive science, but many of the theoretical and empirical tools developed to tackle these problems have not yet been widely adopted in AI research, in part because of the separation between the fields and communities.<br><br>To address the gap above, our goal is to bring together researchers in cognitive science and AI interpretability to discuss new empirical results and theories about the inner workings of deep learning models. We hope to gather perspectives from various disciplines, including machine learning, psychology, linguistics, vision science, neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and law.",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Room 5AB,2025-12-07T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109544,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109544,,

This imbalance leads to poor performance and limited applicability for low-resource languages, which are rich in tone, morphology, and cultural meaning. As a result, current AI systems risk reinforcing linguistic inequality, cultural erasure, and lack of accessibility in critical domains like education and healthcare.This workshop aims to reframe language technology by centering low-resource languages, cultures, and epistemologies in the age of LLMs. We seek to bring together researchers, linguists, developers, healthcare professionals, and technologists to share insights and develop strategies for building inclusive, culturally grounded, and linguistically robust language models. The workshop emphasizes collaboration across disciplines and regions to ensure both technical advancement and social relevance.Key areas of focus include developing LLM architectures tailored to low-resource linguistic features, ethical and community-centered dataset collection, and multilingual benchmarks designed specifically for underrepresented languages. We also highlight the importance of healthcare and medical machine translation to support equitable access to information and improve public health outcomes. Ultimately, this workshop aims to advance responsible AI innovation that empowers low-resource language communities and shapes a more inclusive future for global language technologies.",Workshop,Workshop,Don Alberto 1,2025-12-01T06:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/127830,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/127830,,

Whether tuning a large language model, configuring a vision pipeline, or deploying AI in safety-critical environments, the choice of hyperparameters is decisive. Current tuning strategies such as grid or random search and Bayesian optimization are powerful for empirical optimization but they do not provide statistical guarantees on the reliability of the selected configuration after deployment. This gap becomes critical when models must satisfy strict performance, safety, or fairness requirements.<br><br>This tutorial introduces a rigorous and practical framework that treats hyperparameter selection as a statistical testing problem. By constructing valid p- or e-values for candidate configurations and applying multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) procedures, practitioners can control deployment risk with finite-sample guarantees. We begin with the Learn-Then-Test (LTT) methodology for average-risk control and build up to multiple key extensions, such as controlling the quantile risk using quantile LTT (QLTT), multi-objective optimization through Pareto Testing (PT), incorporating prior information through the concept of reliability graphs, and data-efficient selection through adaptive LTT (aLTT). Throughout the tutorial, we emphasize conceptual clarity, plain-language explanations of assumptions, and hands-on demonstrations with minimal, reproducible notebooks.<br><br>Attendees will gain a drop-in toolkit for augmenting existing tuning workflows with statistically valid selection. They will learn how to formalize relevant risk functions, generate valid evidence, choose appropriate error-rate controls (FWER/FDR), and navigate the trade-offs between statistical conservatism and power under limited data. No prior expertise in multiple hypothesis testing is required.""",Tutorial,Tutorial,Don Alberto 3,2025-12-02T09:30:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/128794,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/128794,,

Three major research communities have emerged to address this challenge through interpretability methods: Explainable AI focuses on feature attribution to understand which input features drive model decisions; Data-Centric AI emphasizes data attribution to analyze how training examples shape model behavior; and Mechanistic Interpretability examines component attribution to understand how internal model components contribute to outputs. These three branches share the goal of better understanding AI systems across different aspects and differ primarily in their perspectives rather than techniques. This tutorial begins with foundational concepts and historical context, providing essential background on why explainability matters and how the field has evolved since its early days. The first technical deep dive covers post hoc explanation methods, data-centric explanation techniques, mechanistic interpretability approaches, and presents a unified framework demonstrating that these methods share fundamental techniques such as perturbations, gradients, and local linear approximations. The second technical deep dive explores inherently interpretable models, clarifying concepts like reasoning (chain-of-thought) LLMs and self-explanatory LLMs in the context of explainability, and techniques for building inherently interpretable LLMs. We also showcase open source tools that make these methods accessible to practitioners. Furthermore, we highlight promising future research directions in interpretability research and the induced future directions in AI more broadly, with applications in model editing, steering, and regulation. Through comprehensive coverage of algorithms, real-world case studies, and practical guidance, attendees will gain both a deep technical understanding of state-of-the-art methods and practical skills to apply interpretability techniques effectively in AI applications.",Tutorial,Tutorial,"Exhibit Hall G,H",2025-12-02T09:30:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/109599,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/109599,,

Large language models and other deep networks rely on highly tuned GPU kernels to achieve state-of-the-art performance; these efficient kernels directly translate to cost and energy savings. In this 2.5-hour in-person tutorial, we demonstrate how LLM-powered agents can generate and optimize GPU kernels for CUDA, HIP/ROCm, and Triton. We begin with a unified primer on GPU‐programming fundamentals and common tooling (memory hierarchy, occupancy, profilers), then introduce an agentic loop: prompt engineering, compiler/profiler feedback as tools, iterative kernel refinement, correctness validation, and automated benchmarking. We will provide additional benchmarking examples on HIP and Triton, on top of Stanford’s KernelBench that covers CUDA [2], KernelBot as reliable source of human curated dataset for heterogenous GPU code [3], and show how to turn runtime and profiler metrics into reward signals that drive kernel optimizations. On top of this loop, we build an inference-scaling framework in which the LLM proposes candidate kernels, compiles them, measures latency/throughput/energy, and feeds those signals back as rewards. By combining test-time scaling techniques the agent iteratively discovers increasingly accurate and efficient kernels. Attendees will compare generated code against expert kernels, inspect wins and losses. By the end, participants will walk away with a reproducible pipeline for LLM-driven GPU‐kernel optimization.",Tutorial,Tutorial,Don Alberto 2,2025-12-02T13:30:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/128792,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/128792,,

Since its inception, stochastic optimization has been grounded in statistical principles. Today, many of the most pressing challenges in machine learning—such as generalization bounds, the training dynamics of overparameterized models, and the development of generative models—are directly inspired by statistical thinking. At the same time, the scale and complexity of modern datasets, along with the increasingly rich model classes used to represent them, pose new questions about how optimization algorithms interact with these structures—both computationally and statistically. For example, what role do data symmetries play in shaping optimization trajectories? How do statistical properties of the data affect the adaptivity and efficiency of learning algorithms? And how can optimization approaches be designed to scale with data while still preserving desirable statistical behavior? OPT 2025 will explore these questions with the goal of building bridges between the statistics and optimization communities, and highlighting their shared impact on the theory and practice of machine learning.<br><br>We are looking forward to seeing you all at OPT 2025, which will take place at the San Diego Convention Center!",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Ballroom 20A,2025-12-06T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109581,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109581,,

Techniques such as chain-of-thought and sampling-based strategies have shown that increasing test-time computation can dramatically enhance model performance. Our recent scaling law analyses highlight the critical role of test-time compute in enabling advanced reasoning, beyond what pretraining can offer. We also provide a practical analysis of hardware efficiency, revealing where bottlenecks arise and how they differ fundamentally from those in pretraining. Scaling test-time compute on modern hardware presents unique challenges. Compared to training workloads, test-time compute often exhibits low parallelism, irregular workload, frequent memory I/O, and dynamic execution paths, all of which make efficient deployment difficult. Therefore, practical scalability is often bottlenecked by system constraints, such as attention-related memory overheads and limited compute utilization. To address these challenges, the community has explored solutions across both systems and algorithms. On the system side, advancements include memory-efficient key-value cache management, optimized attention kernels, and scheduling mechanisms for adaptive resource allocation. On the algorithm side, emerging work has proposed model architectures and parallel generation paradigms that better align with hardware.

In neuroscience, mounting evidence suggests that neural circuits encode task and environmental structure through low-dimensional manifolds, conserved symmetries, and structured transformations. In deep learning, principles such as sparsity, equivariance, and compositionality are guiding the development of more generalizable and interpretable models, including new approaches to foundation model distillation. The NeurReps workshop brings these threads together, fostering dialogue among machine learning researchers, neuroscientists, and mathematicians to uncover unifying geometric principles of neural representation. Just as geometry and symmetry once unified the models of 20th-century physics, we believe they may now illuminate the computational foundations of intelligence.",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Ballroom 6A,2025-12-07T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109551,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109551,,

This workshop will highlight work that demonstrates that, while ML is no silver bullet, it can be an invaluable tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in helping society adapt to the effects of climate change.
<br>
<br>Climate change is a complex problem for which action takes many forms, from advancing theory to deploying new technology. Many of these actions represent high-impact opportunities for real-world change, and simultaneously pose interesting academic research problems.
<br>
<br>The theme of this workshop, “Roots to Routes: A Dialogue on Different Machine Learning Methods for Climate Impact,” invites submissions that explore the strengths of diverse machine learning approaches in climate-related contexts. We particularly encourage work that demonstrates the effectiveness of classical ML methods under real-world constraints, such as limited data availability, privacy concerns, or restricted computational resources. At the same time, we welcome contributions that showcase how scaling up data and computing resources combined with modern tools and techniques can unlock new possibilities for tackling global-scale climate prediction challenges. 
<br>
<br>This workshop is part of a series that aims to bring together those applying ML to climate change challenges and facilitate cross-pollination between ML researchers and experts in climate-relevant fields.

However, it has also exposed a significant gap between theoretical and experimental developments.<br><br>RL theory has grown significantly in the past two decades. Research has characterized the inherent difficulty of various settings and has designed a wide variety of algorithms to reach optimal performances. Furthermore, a huge leap has been made in understanding how to handle large state spaces using function approximation techniques, identifying key structural properties that enable efficient learning.<br><br>Despite theoretical guarantees, applying RL algorithms to complex problems faces challenges. Theoretical algorithms often focus on simplified settings, making them hard to apply to real-world complexities. Furthermore, optimizing for worst-case scenarios, which include unlikely situations, can lead to algorithms that perform poorly on practical tasks. Yet, while specialized algorithms offer empirical success, they might not translate to other problems due to their specific design, and the reliance on heuristics and engineering fixes further widens the gap between theory and practice.<br><br>A prominent area that has seen a surge of interest in RL is generative language modeling. Pre-training these models can be viewed as a form of imitation learning, while post-training typically implements RL algorithms for purposes like instruction tuning with RL from human feedback or enhancing reasoning capabilities. While these successes make the practical utility of RL undeniable, the RL community finds itself at a crossroads. The algorithms employed are frequently variants of classical methods, and exploring beyond these presents a key challenge. Conversely, the success of these models prompts new questions for RL theory, suggesting that frameworks leveraging pre-trained models might offer a more effective paradigm than learning from scratch under traditional assumptions.<br><br>Following the success of the ICML 2024 edition, the Second Workshop on Aligning Reinforcement Learning Experimentalists and Theorists (ARLET) aims to bridge this discrepancy and promote collaboration. By bringing together experts from both sides, we want to facilitate meaningful discussions and draw a path for future RL research. Motivated by the take-home messages from the previous edition, we seek to encourage: (i) theorists to ask experimentalists for concrete problems to solve, and (ii) experimentalists to seek theoretical guidance on how to approach these problems.",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Room 31ABC,2025-12-06T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109542,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109542,,

Workshop on Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models,Workshop,"Simon Yu, Bo Liu, Yifei Zhou, Mickel Liu, Kai Zhang, Hanxu Hu, Leon Guertler, Leshem Choshen, Weiyan Shi",,Accepted,,,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109539,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109539,,109539,Workshop on Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models,workshop on multi-turn interactions in large language models,"The field of AI is entering a new era of interaction, profoundly shaped by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While multi-turn interaction has been a long-standing pursuit in AI—from dialogue systems to multi-agent coordination—the advent of LLMs has radically transformed this landscape. These models now engage in complex, long-horizon interactions, process diverse data, and make crucial decisions in dynamic, human-centric scenarios.<br><br>This leap forward, however, brings forth critical new research questions and challenges that demand immediate attention:<br><br>Multi-Turn RL Learning for Agentic Tasks Learning from complex, interactive environments like GUI agents and tool-use scenarios, given the challenges of sparse rewards.<br>Maintaining Alignment Understanding human values over extended, multi-turn interactions, preventing ""loss of alignment"" seen in current models.<br>Human-AI Interaction Over time, ensuring models adapt to user goals without compromising safety or fairness.<br>Long-horizon Evaluation For LLMs' long-term capabilities, consistency, and strategic abilities in complex, multi-turn tasks.<br>The Workshop on Multi-Turn Interactions in LLMs is designed to be the central forum for addressing these pivotal questions. We invite researchers to contribute to defining the next generation of interactive AI, tackling these core challenges, and charting the course for future advancements in AI reasoning and planning. This workshop will concentrate on key areas where the extended use of LLMs presents both new challenges and opportunities, serving as a platform to discuss and refine methods for future improvements and evaluation for practical LLM use cases.",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Room 11AB,2025-12-06T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109539,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109539,,

Environments are not merely testing grounds; they are dynamic, interactive contexts that serve as the essential ""data"" for agents to learn adaptive behavior, complex reasoning, and long-term decision-making skills. Just as scaling the model size, dataset size, and training computation has led to emergent capabilities in LLMs, scaling the structure, fidelity, and diversity of environments is one of the crucial dimensions in advancing agent intelligence. Moreover, recent advances in end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when paired with LLM-based agents, have made it increasingly viable to train agents through sustained interaction. These agents can now acquire skills, strategies, and planning abilities through environmental feedback, rather than relying solely on imitation learning or static prompt engineering. As we move toward more autonomous, general-purpose agents, the need for scalable, richly interactive, and diverse environments has become both urgent and foundational.",Workshop,Workshop,Upper Level Room 23ABC,2025-12-07T08:00:00,,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109540,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/workshop/109540,,
